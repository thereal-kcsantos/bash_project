# hey_command
Some random tasks.... Maybe application/practice stuff? :wink::wink:

# Purpose
I'm trying some things out here. I want to use this repo to track my changes (and maybe my thought process) as I try to accomplish "the thing".

# Task (aka "The Thing)

An employee runs the command “hey” in their terminal, and we want it to respond with “what’s up." Please write a shell-script that we can deploy through MDM (which runs as root) to implement this.
